## Feature Wish List

- [ ] Auto scale height to room
- [ ] Correct bumper for height
- [ ] Talk to actor when crouching
- [ ] Accurate Body Collision that inflicts size effects on contact
- [ ] Proper headtracking
- [ ] Ability to edit HitBoxes so it'll be possible to have Giant Enemies/Have more accurate hitbox
- [ ] Ability to spawn dust effect explosions literally under the feet, not under center of character. Ideally even scale them.
- [ ] Maybe proper High-Heel module that dynamically adjusts high heel size based on Root scale? Ray-Track from feet to
- [ ] In the perfect scenario, repair Animation Speed based on size (A pain to do, not sure if it's worth it. A lot of people have already tried it)
- [ ] If possible, transfer from SkyrimPlatform to Pure DLL, so SP won't be needed
- [ ] Make DLL track Giantess PC/NPC footsteps to shake the screen/place dust without lags. Currently it has a delay because of script latency.
- [ ] Ray-Tracked Vore instead of dialogue. Vore on button press if conditions are met.
- [ ] Blood on the feet after crushing (Not sure how to do it at all)
- [ ] Vore anim
- [ ] Vore belly
